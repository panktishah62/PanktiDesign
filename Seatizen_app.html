								Seatizen is an online bus(intra-city public transport) ticketing and tracking platform. It provides facilities like live tracking of number of
								seats left in a public transport bus and pre-booking tickets. It has developed a system that will help to inform the capacity of the bus/public transport
								vehicle through sensors embedded in the the public transport and displays the information on the app. It aims to save passenger’s time, money
								and increase convenience.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								It is headquartered in Gandhinagar and partnered with GSRTC and RSRTC to provide its services.
								In 2021, gujarat govt. bought a majority stake in seatizen.

								Being the first product designer to work for the startup, worked directly under the founders to finalize the product.
								I was responsible for conducting user research, understanding pain points, prototyping and designing the product.

								Seatizen's vision was simple : make commuting convenient for thousands of people using public transport daily. There were a lot of issues these people faced :
								<br/>
								<br/>
								1. Most people using public transport on day-to-day basis, went to the bus stop and waited for the bus to arrive with no information on exactly how much time it would take for the bus to come.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								2. Travellers did not know how many seats were unoccupied in the bus they planned to travel , a lot of them had long journeys and would end up standing for 30 minutes for the commute in the bus.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								3. A lot of daily commuters were students who used public transport to save money, but were frustrated because of no
								information updates on the bus, no option of pre-booking seats and in convenience caused due to delays.
							</p>

								<h3 style="font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: 600;">Solution</h3>
							</header>
							<p style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">
								Seatizen solves two crucial problems for both sides of the market – travellers and public transport company (GSRTC).
								<br/>
								<br/>
								For travellers, Seatizen provides an app where they can see all the bus options available for their route, they also can purchase a ticket online through the portal, so they are assured to have a seat on the bus. The app would also provide live tracking updates and display number of seats left. Essentially, travellers end up saving time, money and stress while travelling.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								For govt, Seatizen brings up a better management system, installs sensors, qr code scanner and tracker in their public buses which gives important updates to customers. This leads to more and more people opting for public transport systems, increasing revenue. Seatizen's platform is efficient enough to onboard passengers, allocate seats, and collect payment making life of bus operators very easy.

							</header>
							<p style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%";>
								The insights gathered from the user interviews were that :
								<br/>
								<br/>
								1. Users felt inconvenient waiting for buses without any tracking information.
								<br/>
								2. Users got frustrated when they could not find seats for sitting.
								<br/>
								3. The students and youngsters accounted for large percentage of users using public transport daily.
								<br/>
								4. A big number of people were willing to pay a little extra for better service.
								<br/>
								5. 78% of people knew how to operate a smart-phone.
								<br/>
								6. Females were more concerned about their security while travelling through public transport. Pregnant women and women with children who used public transport wanted some option to pre-book so they have an assured seat on the bus.
								<br/>
								7. Daily commuters felt buying tickets everyday was tiring since many of them took it on the bus from the conductor or from a booth on the bus station where they had to stand in long lines.
								They wanted an easier way to purchase tickets.

								Our high level goal was to design a ticket-booking and live tracking platform where users can track buses, get updates on number of seats left in real time and track the buses in real time. Also, they can see scheduled times, available travel options
								as well as options available for a particular route.

							</header>
							<p style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">
								To validate the use cases and the improvements, we conducted multiple rounds of user testing with participants on functional prototypes. We recorded their responses and compared the data. With each round of testing there was one thing that worked perfectly, we took each nugget that worked right and modified the design to what it is currently.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Objective
								The goal of the study is to investigate the information architecture and weather the users are able to complete basic tasks. The checkpoints were defined as :
								<br/>
								<br/>
								1. Enter the To and From location along with the date and time of travel and hit search.
								<br/>
								2. Browse through the options of buses available, and select any one bus.
								<br/>
								3. Go through the bus details and understand the change of buses(if applies), and move to booking page.
								<br/>
								4. Select seats for the buses and move to the last step of booking.
								<br/>
								5. Add traveller details and checkout.
								<br/>
								6. From the payment screen, do payments and view the ticket booked.
								<br/>
								7. From the home page, under bookings/passes, see if the user is able to access the upcoming bookings.
								<br/>
								8. Go through the help section and raise a request or contact customer support.
								<br/>
								9. Navigate through the profile section from the home page.

								This section marks the beginning of UI deliverables.
								It's the most exciting part of the design process. It's also the most comprehensive and crucial project stage as it involves designing detailed mockups of the website,
								designing the logo, choosing an appropriate color scheme and typeface and eventually setting up a style guide that describes the usage of each type of design elements
								used in the app.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Based on several rounds of testing, I noted down the user preferences and tried to inculcate in the interfaces.
