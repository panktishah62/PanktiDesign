                    Audit Plan Management is a planning and data analytics platform that helps you plan projects, allocate resource and manage staff for
                    financial auditing projects. It also helps users explore, analyze and share real-time project analytics data easily.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Projects are planned, managed and tracked on the APM platform by the auditors. APM is a legacy platform and had a lot of shortcomings,
                    to address the same a new dashboard is required where the auditors can manage the projects , financial analysts can see the feedback and product owners
                    can get the exact insights required for the improvement.

                    The interface of APM Platform currently does not allow the users to go through the project details
                    of the project created in the past, add roles and edit the project on the go. The existing users find interface
                    very non-intuitive and new users find it very difficult to operate.

                    <br/>
                    It also does not have a built-in analytics tool and takes the user to the third party app
                    to view data analytics.

                    A better layout functionality
                    can help make audit board more compelling and engaging and make the product more complete as
                    a planning and management tool.

                    1. As an auditor, I want to make new projects on a single click, get project information in a structurised way and edit it on the go.
                    <br/>
                    2. As a financial analyst, I want to see all the projects I am assigned to, filter them easilt based on year, coverage, type and other parameters.
                    <br/>
                    3. As a project owner, I want to see analytics and metrics of the project to get insights.

                    <br/>
                    1. Allow users to create and organize projects in one click, display project information effectively.
                    <br/>
                    2. Allow users to add new projects by prompting them to add only compulsory information and not overwhelm them
                    to fill information that can be filled later in the life cycle as the project progresses.
                    <br/>
                    3. Allow users to navigate between the sections of project details easily, jump quickly without having to scroll down to a particular section.
                    <br/>
                    4. Allow users to view metrics of their project in visually appealing and insightful manner.

                    Having defined the area we had to focus on, we moved on to ideation. Starting with analysing the existing tool.
                    We further tried to understand how users currently address this problem. We investigated the mental model around how users navigated through the existing platform.

                    This is the current dashboard being used for audit plan management. It does not have a clear hierarchy for sections,

                    After several brainstorming sessions, throwing ideas around and quick paper sketches we
                    came up with several approaches to visualise project information effectively.
                    Keeping in mind the tech constraints, user pain points and the established mental models
                    we proposed three different approaches.

                To validate the use cases and the improvements, we conducted multiple rounds of user testing
                with a dozen of participants on functional prototypes. We recorded their responses and compared the data.
                With each round of testing there was one thing that worked perfectly,
                we took each nugget that worked right and modified the design to what it is currently.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Also, for final decision of how to organise information under project information section , we conducted
                user testing for three prototypes - one where information was categorised in horizontal tabs,
                one with where it is categorised in different containers and one where information is split categorically into
                vertical scroll.

                <br/>
                The goal of the study was to investigate the new design ideations around layout of the dashboard. Goals for the design include:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                1. Understand the mental model around how users organize and share data.
                <br/>
                2. Methods they use, needs they have around data sharing and organizing.
                <br/>
                3. Prevent overwhelming the user
                <br/>
                4. Determine efficiency of design and usability within working user flows.
                <br/>
                5. Establish ease of user navigation, clarity in copy and call-to-action in sectioning, grouping, navigation journeys.
                <br/>
                6. Identify potential anomalies in IA, task flow, visual/content hierarchy and usability.
                <br/>
                7. Evaluate the success based on test completion and error-free rates.
                <br/>
                8. Identify pain points and areas of improvement in navigation, content, design and usability

                After feedbacks from user studies and considering the existing design of the dashboard few decisions were made :
                <br/>
                <br/>
                1. The main screen of the audit board to be kept in grid form, for easy visualisation of the various projects.
                Filters to be removed from side bar and dynamic filtering to be added.
                <br/>
                2. The project view screen should contain two main sections : Summary and Project Information.
                <br/>
                3. Create new project button to be added on the main screen.
                <br/>
                4. New Project creation should have base minimum details to be added on-start.
                <br/>
                5. The project Information section to be added under summary in the project view page,
                    where the information will be categorised into horizontal tabs. Each tab containing groups that are to be filled together.

                It was a great learning opportunity for me, where I understood the importance of hierarchy and Information architecture in depth.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The project received very good response and the time taken to navigate through projects, track and manage them
                was reduced by 42%.
