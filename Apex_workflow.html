                    Audit Plan Management is a planning and data analytics platform that helps you plan projects, allocate resource and manage staff for
                    financial auditing projects. It also helps users explore, analyze and share real-time project analytics data easily.

                    <br/>
                    Data is visualized in apex through dashboards we call workflow. Workflow help project-owners to extract useful information out of the dashboard,
                    thus making it easy for anyone to drill down, analyze data, present and download reports.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Users need visualizations that intuitively represent their use case. They must feel confident when presenting insights from workflow in terms of branding, typography and colours

                    Started from research, conceptualising the flows to creating the visual design,

                <p style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 400; padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">
                    Currently, there is no dashboard to analyse the project information on Apex. On doing extensive user research,
                    we found project owners found it very difficult to understand data from the apex project information section, they
                    had to manually collect data and form insights - making it an extremely time consuming and tedious task.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Thus, we came to a conclusion of adding a custom dashboard that displays project details data, with
                    correct visualisations for all projects on APEX.
                    <br/>

                    To understand the user pain points better, interviews were conducted with users using the existing platform.
                    The product was mainly built for project owners looking to collect and get estimations for the project.

                    1. As a staff allocation specialist, I want to get project information in a structurised way such that I can analyse the hours, coverage and business risks involved in the project.

                    2. As a project manager, I want to view the project information in a graphical manner, so that it becomes easy for me to present it to my stakeholders.
                    <br/>
                    3. As an Analyst, I want to view project information, coverage and locations in a more structured way, so I can quickly get a glimpse and form insights.

                    Our high level goals was to build a simple and intuitive dashboard that displays information for each project on Apex dashboard. The dashboard should contain all information on staffing,
                    budget hours and project details, so that our users can get insights by just taking a glance.

                    Having defined the area we had to focus on, we moved on to ideation. Starting with analysing the existing tool.
                    We further tried to understand how users currently address this problem. We investigated the mental model around how users navigated through the existing platform.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                   We further decided to add a workflow button on project's main page, which would take the user to the dashboard to view data.

                    We checked other apps and platforms with similar functionality for
                    insights into common patterns to understand userâ€™s mental model - Invision, Marvel, Zeplin,
                    Microsoft PowerPoint etc. and prepared moodboards to explore creative ways to solve the existing problems.

                    <br/>
                    Based on common patterns we observed, wireframes were made to see the initial user response.

                    To validate the use cases and the improvements, we conducted multiple rounds of user testing
                    with a dozen of participants on functional prototypes. We recorded their responses and compared the data.
                    With each round of testing there was one thing that worked perfectly,
                    we took each nugget that worked right and modified the design to what it is currently.

                    The goal of the study is to investigate the new design ideations around workflow layout. Goals for the design include :
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    1. Understand the mental model around how users analysed and viewed data.
                    <br/>
                    2. Methods they use, needs they have around data sharing and organizing.
                    <br/>
                    3. Prevent overwhelming the user
                    Determine efficiency of design and usability within working user flows
                    Establish ease of user navigation, clarity in copy and call-to-action moving from Apex to Workflow.
                    Identify potential anomalies in IA, task flow, visual/content hierarchy and usability.
                    Evaluate the success based on test completion and error-free rates.
                    Identify pain points and areas of improvement in navigation, content, design and usability.

                    It was a great learning opportunity for me, where I learn a lot about navigation and userflows and how to
                    efficiently integrate new features into existing products.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Based on user testing performed with project managers, auditors and financial analysts for the final feedback, we received good response.
                    The information for particular projects are now viewed on workflow instead of how they were analysed manually previously.
