                    Froker is the world’s first social food delivery platform.
                    It allows the users to order the food recommended by food influencers a.k.a frokers. Frokers in-turn can post food reels,
                    images and posts and monetise their audience while users get to discover the best dishes around the town.

                    Froker team approached me to design their app, website and brand identity.
                    I worked closely with the founders to understand their vision, the app's target audience and understand the food - tech space.
                    We extended the visual design and aesthetic to create a playful app to serve the young target audience. Hight contract typography, custom illustration, eclectic accent colours,
                    micro animations, colourful interfaces guiding the user at every step.

                    The default steps that most people follow before ordering food are to explore different dishes on a food app, see reviews & ratings, visit different food delivery apps and make a note of what they are offering at that price listed. Some respondents also said they check food recommendations from bloggers and even take suggestions from their friends or people who have tasted new dishes they would like to try before.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The chief factors that influence one's food choices are the pricing details, reviews & ratings, favourite cuisines, photos & videos, a detailed description, knowledge about the restaurant and information on ingredients.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This brings us to a short conclusion on what the users are expecting from a platform like Froker: Close this gap - researching heavily on different apps for different dishes, then comparing them and basing your decision after a word of mouth referral from your friend or favourite food blogger. Any activity that you search on Froker should display all of this information. It should also be a good social experience where users order food while enjoying the food feed features.

                    Froker solves two crucial problems for both sides of the marketplace – Users and restaurants.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For Users, Froker provides a social media platform where they can browse through hundreds of dishes on the food feed that are posted by influencers and choose the right one with confidence. Essentially it delivers modern reviews and search capabilities for this product type which users have come to expect for any significant purchase. So, essentially, they save time, money and stress while getting a dish, and try out new cuisines with assurance and recommendations from their favourite bloggers.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For restaurants, Froker brings qualified new customers and enables restaurants to display and build their brand credibly. They do not charge any commission from the restaurants. The local restaurants' digital infrastructure and small teams limit their ability to effectively market and distribute their dishes to their core consumer. Froker helps to easily modernize this process, allowing the food bloggers to market the dishes through posts on the app.

                    To understand the users better, I conducted some qualitative survey and interviews along with team from froker.
                    The brainstorming sessions that followed was very useful and paved a way to ideation and in-turn a completely new way of
                    food-app interaction was later structured. Few of the questions we were finding answers to were :

                    It's the most exciting part of the design process. It's also the most comprehensive and crucial project stage as it involves designing detailed mockups of the website,

                    The goal of the study was to understand if the users were able to perform main tasks like ordering food, find restaurants, browse through the social feed, follow food influencers, put a dish in cart through a food post posted by an influencer.
                    The high level objectives of the study were to determine efficiency of design and usability with user flows of the app, identify potential anomalies in information architecture, identify pain points and establish ease of user navigation.

                    Based on many rounds of user testing, there were lot of feedbacks collected, analysed and thereafter implemented, making the designs what they are today.

                    We saw a lot of users scrolling through our social media- food feed and ordering dishes recommended by bloggers from the posts.
                    It was an extremely comprehensive project starting from research, analysis, interviewing, structurising , prototyping, testing and ultimately designing for froker.

                    The app saw overwhelming downloads when it was launched on playstore with good acceptance and appreciation for the interface.
